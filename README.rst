JupyterNotebooks illustrating the use of TeNPy
----------------------------------------------

This repo is a collection of `jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_ illustrating calls to `TeNPy <https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy>`_.

Feel free to suggest and add further examples!

To make the notebooks include nicely into the `TeNPy documentation <https://tenpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#jupyter-notebooks>`,
please add a cell with the title of the example at the beginning, and use only subtitles afterwards.
